I build tools that help people think, remember, create, and make. My projects sit at the intersection of AI-assisted workflows, maker culture, reading and literature, and self-directed learning. I create apps to aid and manage executive and memory differences for neurodivergence.

## Current Projects

### 🪚 [Cabineato](https://github.com/gregheerkens/cabineato)
A simple web app for generating "rough and ready" cabinetry and utility furniture, optimized for CNC workflows. On the fly, can configure dimensions, materials, and features. It then exports SVG/DXF with Vectric-compatible layers, and even a manual cutlist for traditional woodworking or project management. 
UI includes 3D preview, System 32 shelf pin support, dogbone fillets, and dados.

**Tech:** Next.js, TypeScript, Maker.js, Three.js/React Three Fiber

### 🏛️ [Lyceum](https://github.com/gregheerkens/lyceum)
An open learning platform for self-directed learners to collate, study, and verify understanding of niche or decentralized topics, where information may be scattered or hard to come by. Lyceum aims to make learners feel confident in practical topic mastery - without credentialing.
Integrates learning materials (videos, books, podcasts, courses) with discussion, annotation, assessment, and persistent personal learning records. AI bootstrapped and intended to be community curated.

**Tech:** Node.js, TypeScript, Express, GraphQL, PostgreSQL

### ✍️ [Linewright](https://github.com/gregheerkens/linewright)
AI-powered writing assistant with voice retention and uncanny prediction. A PWA that provides inline "ghost text" suggestions as you type—accept with Tab, and the AI learns your writing style through medium and long-form context. Intended to maintain author voice while moving at the speed of voice dictation.

**Tech:** React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Vite

### 🎯 [Dispatch](https://github.com/gregheerkens/dispatch)
A personal command center built on an Obsidian vault and a multi-agent Claude backend. Six specialized lane officers (Jobs, Build, Learn, Home, Write, Self) and a finance officer run parallel standups, maintain private memory, and synthesize cross-lane priorities through a Dispatch coordinator. Designed for people managing too many things at once.

**Tech:** Python, FastAPI, Anthropic API, Obsidian

### 📓 [Artifakts](https://github.com/gregheerkens/artifakts)
A local-first, multimodal journaling witness for people who struggle with journaling, or are afflicted with memory disorders. Uses Socratic questioning to help the journaler reflect without giving advice. The guide simply asks neutral, curious questions. 
All data stays on your device, and entries are linked to similar tags within the journal for pattern recognition and cross-reference.

**Tech:** React, TypeScript, sql.js (SQLite), Vite

### 📚 [Reko](https://github.com/gregheerkens/reko-ui)
A genome-based book recommendation platform. Track your reading, rate books, and discover your next favorite through personalized recommendations.

**Tech:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

## Approach

I develop using an AI-first protocol of my own design, called **DOCTIO**. It is a deterministic workflow for AI-assisted software development that aims to minimize stochasticity while creating quality documentation as a by-product:

1. **Domain** — Problem space and user stories
2. **Objects** — Data models and interfaces
3. **Code Ethos** — Style, patterns, and conventions
4. **Tests** — ABA triangulation test specification
5. **Implementation** — Feature slices and acceptance criteria
6. **Optimization** — Performance and refinement

This methodology ensures specification-driven development with clear behavioral boundaries, making AI collaboration predictable and reliable.
